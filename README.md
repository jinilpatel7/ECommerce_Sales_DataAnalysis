Ecom Insights Dashboard: A Power BI dashboard providing real-time insights into e-commerce sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and financial health. It consolidates data from various sources, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize inventory, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost profitability. 

OBJECTIVE:

To develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for the e-commerce sales team that provides real-time insights into sales performance, product performance, geographical distribution, shipping efficiency, and overall financial health. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making to improve sales strategies, optimize inventory management, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

Current Situation: The e-commerce business has been collecting extensive sales data, including details on orders, shipping, customer demographics, products, and financial metrics. However, the data is currently siloed in Excel spreadsheets, making it challenging to derive actionable insights quickly and efficiently. There is a need to consolidate this data into an interactive dashboard that can provide a holistic view of the business performance.
